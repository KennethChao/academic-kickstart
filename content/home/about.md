# Biography

I am a PhD candidate at the Texas A&M Human Rehabilitation Group. My research expierence include optimal control, trajectory optimization and mechtronics for different bipedal systems.
At human rehablitation group, I mainly work on improving trajectory optimization algorithms to generate human-like or robust walking motions on different terrains, which aimmed for using on lower-limb assisting devices.
